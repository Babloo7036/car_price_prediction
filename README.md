# Car Price Prediction Web App

This is a **Car Price Prediction** web application built using **Streamlit**. The app leverages a **Linear Regression** machine learning model to estimate the price of old cars based on various input features.

## Live Demo
Check out the web app: [Car Price Prediction](https://car-price-prediction-2-hw0k.onrender.com)

## Features
- User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.
- Predicts the price of a used car based on user inputs.
- Uses a **Linear Regression Model** for predictions.
- Hosted on **Render** for easy access.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning Model**: Linear Regression (implemented using Scikit-Learn)
- **Deployment**: Render

## Dataset
I have download dataset from kaggle and it columns feature name,	year, selling price, km driven,	fuel,	seller type, transmission,	owner,	mileage,	engine, max power,	torque, seats.
### Description of dataset
### 1. Name
Description: The name or model of the car, often including the brand.

Data Type: Categorical (Text).

### 2. Year
Description: The year the car was manufactured.

Data Type: Numerical (Integer).

### 3. Selling Price
Description: The price at which the car was sold (or is listed to be sold).

Data Type: Numerical (Continuous).

### 4. KM Driven
Description: The total distance the car has traveled in kilometers.

Data Type: Numerical (Integer).

### 5. Fuel
Description: The type of fuel the car uses.

Data Type: Categorical.

### 6. Seller Type
Description: The type of seller listing the car for sale.

Data Type: Categorical.

### 7. Transmission
Description: The type of transmission system.

Data Type: Categorical.

### 8. Owner
Description: The ownership status of the car (first owner, second owner, etc.).

Data Type: Categorical.

### 9. Mileage
Description: The fuel efficiency of the car (distance traveled per unit of fuel).

Data Type: Numerical (Continuous).

### 10. Engine
Description: The engine capacity, often measured in cubic centimeters (cc).

Data Type: Numerical (Integer/String depending on format).

### 11. Max Power
Description: The maximum power output of the car engine, usually measured in horsepower (bhp).

Data Type: Numerical (Continuous/String if mixed units).

### 12. Torque
Description: The rotational force generated by the engine, often listed with units like Nm (Newton meters).

Data Type: Text/String (because of mixed units and formats).

## How to Use
1. Open the web app using the provided link.
2. Enter the required details such as **year of purchase, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, etc.**
3. Click the "Predict" button.
4. The predicted car price will be displayed instantly.

## Installation & Setup (For Local Deployment)
If you want to run the web app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing historical car sales data, including features such as **year of purchase, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type**.

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy by trying different algorithms.
- Add more input features for better predictions.
- Enhance UI/UX for a better user experience.
