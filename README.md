# car_price_prediction

## Steps for the project
1. Data collection and understanding
2. Performing EDA
3. Train machine learning model
4. Creating webapp
5. Deploying webapp

## 1. Data collection and understanding
I have download dataset from kaggle and it columns feature name,	year, selling price, km driven,	fuel,	seller type, transmission,	owner,	mileage,	engine, max power,	torque, seats.
## Description of dataset
### 1. Name
Description: The name or model of the car, often including the brand.

Data Type: Categorical (Text).

### 2. Year
Description: The year the car was manufactured.

Data Type: Numerical (Integer).

### 3. Selling Price
Description: The price at which the car was sold (or is listed to be sold).

Data Type: Numerical (Continuous).

### 4. KM Driven
Description: The total distance the car has traveled in kilometers.

Data Type: Numerical (Integer).

### 5. Fuel
Description: The type of fuel the car uses.

Data Type: Categorical.

### 6. Seller Type
Description: The type of seller listing the car for sale.

Data Type: Categorical.

### 7. Transmission
Description: The type of transmission system.

Data Type: Categorical.

### 8. Owner
Description: The ownership status of the car (first owner, second owner, etc.).

Data Type: Categorical.

### 9. Mileage
Description: The fuel efficiency of the car (distance traveled per unit of fuel).

Data Type: Numerical (Continuous).

### 10. Engine
Description: The engine capacity, often measured in cubic centimeters (cc).

Data Type: Numerical (Integer/String depending on format).

### 11. Max Power
Description: The maximum power output of the car engine, usually measured in horsepower (bhp).

Data Type: Numerical (Continuous/String if mixed units).

### 12. Torque
Description: The rotational force generated by the engine, often listed with units like Nm (Newton meters).

Data Type: Text/String (because of mixed units and formats).


## 2. Performing EDA
In our dataset we have two type of datatype numerical and categorical 

numerical data column = ['year'], ['selling_price'], ['km_driven'], ['seats']

categorical data column = ['name'], ['fuel'], ['seller_type'], ['transmission'], ['owner'], 

mixed data column =  ['mileage'], ['engine'], ['max_power'], ['torque']

### Handling null values
we have missing data columns ['mileage'], ['engine'], ['max_power'], ['seats']
Its has 2.8% missing data in each column so we can directaly drop them.
### Handling mixed data
I am creating fuction to spliting data from space between words

def clean_data(value):

    value = value.split(' ')[0]
    
    value = value.strip()
    
    if value == '':
        
        value = 0
    
    return float(value)

### handling categorical data
replacing numerical numbers to unique values of each column
